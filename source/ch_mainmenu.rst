The USB page can be accessed by selecting ‘USB’ from the main menu. USB mode can then be toggled on/off to enable access to the transmitter’s file-system from a USB equipped computer. In this mode the file system of Deviation is accessible as a mass storage device. This will allow you to move files back and forth between the Deviation file-system and a PC. All configuration files are accessible in this mode.
