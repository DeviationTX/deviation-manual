A Note About this Manual
========================

.. if:: devo8
The images in this manual will generally show the Devo6/8 interface, though in some cases the Devo12 image will be used instead where it better depicts the capabilities.  While the Devo6/8 and Devo12 screens may look a little different in some cases, they will generally have identical behavior.  Situations where the Devo6, 8, or 12 behave differently will be noted accordingly.

.. endif::
.. if:: devo10

The images in this manual will generally show the Devo7e/10/12E interface.  In some cases the Devo7e may not support a given feature or the screen may be slightly different. Situations where the Devo7e, 10, or 12E behave differently will be noted accordingly.
