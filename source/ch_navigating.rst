**Text Boxes**:  Text boxes generally provide information, however in some cases they can be clicked to perform an action (like a button)

Navigating with the physical buttons
------------------------------------

* On all menu pages, ‘UP’ and ‘DN’ are used to navigate to the previous/next item.
* The ‘R+’ and ‘L-’ buttons are used on spin-box widgets to increase or decrease the selected value. In some cases holding down the button will use larger step values to move more quickly to the desired value.
* For buttons and rounded-spin-boxes, pressing ENT’ will press the button,
* Pressing ‘EXT’ will remove selection form the current item.  A long-press of ‘EXT’ will exit one (1) menu level.
