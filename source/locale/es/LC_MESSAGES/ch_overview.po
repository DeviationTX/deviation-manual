"Deviation is a replacement firmware for the Walkera Devention™ series (Devo)"
" transmitters.  The primary goal is to add support for multiple protocols, "
"opening the full potential of this platform. The core of the deviation "
"firmware is the mixer system, which is modeled after the system used in the "
"Er9X firmware for the Turnigy/Flysky9x™ transmitters."

"Deviation also brings USB file-system support, making it easy to manage the "

"Deviation has been designed for ultimate configurability. All model and "
"transmitter configuration is controlled through text files which the "
"firmware (or user) can read and write. It is easy to know exactly what is "
"configured, as well as to modify the configuration either through the "
"transmitter or with a text editor. The main screen is very customizable; any"
" mix of inputs, switches, channel data, or timers can be displayed, and "
"configured per-model."
