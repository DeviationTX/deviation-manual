"If you do not have the Windows™ operating system, go with the first choice, "
"the Deviation Uploader tool. It is a Java application that was designed by "
"the Deviation developer team to be efficient and simple to use with any Devo"
" radio and any version of deviation or even Devention, if you should wish to"
" revert to the original Walkera firmware. The Walkera tool uses a two-step "
"approach, in which you first install the firmware, then the filesystem "
"library. The Deviation Uploader tool does the same thing in one simple, "
"convenient step, using the ZIP compressed deviation firmware file as the "
"source."
