"The images in this manual will generally show the Devo6/8 interface, "
"though in some cases the Devo12 image will be used instead where it "
"better depicts the capabilities.  While the Devo6/8 and Devo12 screens "
"may look a little different in some cases, they will generally have "
"identical behavior.  Situations where the Devo6, 8, or 12 behave "
"differently will be noted accordingly."
