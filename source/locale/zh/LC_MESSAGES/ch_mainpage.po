"Deviation has a safety system to prevent starting up in a dangerous state "
"(for instance spinning up the main rotor of a helicopter accidentally). The "
"safety system works by verifying that specific conditions are met before "
"starting to transmit to the model.  By default the output channel associated"
" with the throttle stick must be minimum.  The Deviation firmware does not "
"include a mechanism to define new safety conditions, however, they can be "
"added by directly modifying the model.ini file. While the safety message is "
"displayed, the transmitter will not communicate with the model.  This "
"message may appear either when initially turning on the transmitter, or when"
" switching to a different model. The message will disappear automatically "
"once all safety conditions have been met or when 'OK' is pressed.  In either"
" case, Deviation will start communication with the model once the dialog is "
"dismissed."

"The 'Auto' value can also be any channel or input name, 'Ch1', etc. The "
"'Auto' tries to guess your throttle channel number. If that isn't working, "
"and you're getting an unwanted warning, then changing it to 'Ch1' (DSMx "
"protocols) or 'CH3' (most other protocols) will fix the problem. The 'min' "
"value can also be 'max' or 'zero', to test that the channel or stick is at "
"the maximum value and 0."
