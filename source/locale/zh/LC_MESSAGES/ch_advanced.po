"Deviation can be used to act as either the instructor (master) or student "
"(slave) transmitter in a buddy-box configuration.  In this mode, the "
"instructor and student connect their respective transmitters together with a"
" trainer cord via the DSC port.  The instructor’s transmitter will actually "
"communicate with the model, but the instructor can use a switch to allow the"
" student to control the model.  When the switch is enabled, the student’s "
"transmitter sends input (stick) information through the trainer cord to the "
"instructor’s transmitter and these inputs replace the instructor’s inputs."

msgid ""
"A swash-plate is used to control flight on an RC helicopter.  The swash-"
"plate controls the plane of rotation of the main-rotor as well as the blade "
"pitch.  A swash plate is normally connected to 3 servos known as Elevator, "
"Aileron, and Collective, but due to its design, there is not a 1-to-1 "
"correspondence between stick-movement and the servo movement.  Instead some "
"mixing is necessary between the throttle, elevator and aileron sticks and "
"the swash-plate servos.  This mixing is known as cyclic Collective Pitch "
"Mixing (CCMP)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ch_advanced.rst:102
msgid ""
"Traditionally, RC helicopters have used a flybar above or below the main "
"rotor attached to a series of linkages to maintain stability.  In these "
"setups, the transmitter will normally do all of the mixing, and directly "
"drive each of the 3 swash-plate servos.  This configuration is known as "
"manual-CCPM (mCCPM).  Alternatively, an electronic mixer can be included on "
"the helicopter either as part of the receiver, or between the receiver and "
"servos, that can implement the proper mixing.  This configuration is known "
"as electronic CCPM (eCCPM) and in this case, the transmitter directly "
"supplies aileron, elevator, and collective inputs, and the electronic mixer "
"will convert the signals into appropriate swash-plate servo motion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/ch_advanced.rst:104
msgid ""
"Recently, flybarless (FBL) helicopters have become more common, especially "
"in the micro size range.  These helicopters use an eCCPM system along with "
"an electronic gyroscope to continuously adjust the swash-plate to maintain "
"stability without the need for a physical flybar.  This setup tends to be "
"less expensive to manufacture, and also provides better stability and more "
"precise control."

"**120 (3 Servo)**: Servos are placed around the swash-plate at 120° "

"plate left and right; with Elevator input, the three servos tilt the swash-"
"plate fore and aft; with Pitch input, all three servos raise the swash-plate"

msgid ""
"**140 (3 Servo)**: Fundamentally, the servo operations of 140° swash-plates "
"are almost the same as 120° swash-plates. However, the servo arrangement for"
" elevator operation differs. 140° swash-plate CCPM offers smoother operation"
" of the combined servos and an equal cyclic rate all around. On a 120° "
