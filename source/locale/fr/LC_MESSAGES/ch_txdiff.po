"The images in this manual will generally show the Devo6/8 interface, though "
"in some cases the Devo12 image will be used instead where it better depicts "
"the capabilities.  While the Devo6/8 and Devo12 screens may look a little "
"different in some cases, they will generally have identical behavior.  "
"Situations where the Devo6, 8, or 12 behave differently will be noted "
"accordingly."

"The images in this manual will generally show the Devo7e/10/12E interface.  "
"In some cases the Devo7e may not support a given feature or the screen may "
"be slightly different. Situations where the Devo7e, 10, or 12E behave "
"differently will be noted accordingly."
